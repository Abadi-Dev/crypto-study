- encryption does not provide integrity,
    if an atacker play or modify the ciphertext,
    the decryptor would not know because the encryption does
    not guarntee integrity, but provide confidentiality.

    for example if an attacker knows where a specific value lies
    in the ciphertext,
    he can change the bits by flipping them resulting in
    a diffirent value in the plaintext
